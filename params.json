In our opinion none of then are focused on integrating the messages with other systems. i8583 was designed from outside in to integrate with other frameworks and to allow easy extension to implement the several different ISO 8583 flavors. i8583 does only thing parse and create ISO 8583 message and leaves the other aspects such as transmission  or validation to other frameworks like Spring or Camel.\r\n  \r\n    * Designed to play well with other libraries - Spring Integration, Smooks, Camel\r\n    \r\n    * Designed to be extended to create multiple implementations\r\n  \r\n    * Focused on doing only one thing and doing it right - Parse and create ISO Messages\r\n  \r\n    * OSGI Enabled\r\n  \r\n    * {{{./license.html#Apache_License}Apache 2.0 license}}\r\n   \r\n{Getting Started}","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
